This project is aimed to analyze the death rate and infection rate during COVID using SQL, and demonstrate the result using Tableau. 
- I built a line chart of the infection rate in USA, Belgium, and Australia from Feb2020 to March2021, and introduced the forecasted rate in the next six months.
- I used a chart to showcase the overall total cases, total deaths and death rate in the whole world.
- I also broke things further with continent and showed the total deaths with a bar chart.
- Finally I demonstrated the percent of population infected in a map.
